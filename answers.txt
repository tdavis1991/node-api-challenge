1. Two parts of express i've learned and enjoy to use are routes and middleware. Setting up routes help take out a lot of boilerplates when building a project. Middleware helps in many ways, a few examples could be you become more preductive when coding and it can help secure sensitive information.

2. Middleware can be actions performed inside http request that can alter data, send the dev certain information back upon request etc.

4. To show the client the request was sucessful you could send back a status code in the 200s depending on the request and send a message back telling the request was sucessful.

5. In order to make sub-applications you could break your code down in files and import them to your main file and use server.use and routes to connect them.
